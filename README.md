# Exno.7-Develop a prompt-based application tailored to their personal needs, fostering creativity and practical problem-solving skills while leveraging the capabilities of large language models.
### Name: SURIYA M
### Register no.: 212223110055
## Aim:
To develop a prompt-based application using ChatGPT — demonstrating how to create a prompt-based system that organizes daily tasks, schedules reminders, suggests wellness tips, and answers general queries, showcasing the progression from simple to more advanced prompt designs and their corresponding outputs.

## AI Tools Required:
ChatGPT (Large Language Model by OpenAI)

Optional: Google Colab / Python Command-Line Interface (for simulation)

## Explanation:

This experiment focuses on creating a personal productivity assistant using prompt engineering.
The assistant is designed to help manage daily activities like scheduling, reminders, and wellness suggestions. It interacts naturally with the user, adapts to their habits, and responds intelligently to queries.

By crafting structured and layered prompts, students learn how to extract meaningful, context-aware outputs from AI models and how such systems can be used for practical problem-solving in real-world scenarios.

## Prompt:

“Design a personal productivity assistant that can help manage daily tasks, schedule reminders, suggest wellness tips, and answer general queries. The assistant should interact using natural language and be adaptable to the user’s changing preferences over time.”

## Procedure:

Define the Core Requirements:
Identify functionalities: task management, reminders, scheduling, wellness tips, and question answering.
Determine interaction style (text-based conversational assistant).

### Construct Appropriate Prompts:

Example 1: “Add a new task: Complete AI assignment by 5 PM.”

Example 2: “Show me my pending tasks for today.”

Example 3: “Remind me to drink water every 2 hours.”

Example 4: “Give me a wellness tip for today.”

### Simulate Natural User Interaction:

Implement using a simple text-based interface (e.g., command-line chat).

ChatGPT or another LLM responds contextually based on user input.

### Collect and Adapt Based on Feedback:

User provides corrections or new instructions.

The assistant modifies its responses and preferences (simulated memory).

### Integrate Basic Memory:

Store user preferences (e.g., “User prefers morning reminders”).

Use this to personalize future responses.

### Expected Output:
Personal Productivity Assistant Features

#### 1. Daily Task Manager:

Accepts natural commands like: “Remind me to call mom at 6 PM.”

Organizes tasks by priority and deadlines.

Provides summaries: “You have 3 tasks today. The next one is due at 6 PM.”

#### 2. Smart Scheduler:

Schedules events contextually: “Add meeting with project team at 4 PM tomorrow.”

Alerts on conflicts: “You already have a task scheduled at that time. Would you like to reschedule?”
Suggests free time slots.

#### 3. Wellness Tips Generator:

Suggests daily wellness activities: “Take a 10-minute walk to refresh your mind.”

Adapts tips based on feedback: “Since you prefer yoga, here’s a short stretch routine for today.”

#### 4. General Query Assistant:

Answers knowledge-based questions: “What are the benefits of meditation?”

Provides motivational quotes or time management advice.

#### Sample Output (Example Chat Simulation):
```
User: “Remind me to submit my report by 8 PM.”
Assistant: “Got it! I’ll remind you at 8 PM to submit your report.”
```
```
User: “What are my pending tasks for today?”
Assistant: “You have two pending tasks: 1) Submit your report by 8 PM, 2) Prepare slides for tomorrow’s meeting.”
```
```
User: “Give me a wellness tip.”
Assistant: “Take a 5-minute screen break every hour to rest your eyes and stay energized.”
```
```
User: “Add a new task: Water the plants at 7 AM.”
Assistant: “Task added successfully!”
```

## Result:

The lab exercise resulted in the creation of a prototype concept for a personal productivity assistant powered by large language models.
Students were able to:

Understand how to tailor LLM prompts to real-life applications.

Foster creativity by designing personalized assistant features.

Learn prompt engineering techniques for effective human-AI interaction.

Experience how generative AI can solve everyday organizational and wellness challenges.

## Conclusion:
A prompt-based personal productivity assistant was successfully designed using ChatGPT. The system demonstrated how structured prompt engineering can create a multifunctional AI assistant that helps manage daily tasks, schedules, and wellness recommendations effectively.
